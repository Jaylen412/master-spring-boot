# 🚀 Spring Boot Learning Project

A hands-on learning project designed to explore **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data JPA**, **Docker**, and **AWS** integration.  
This repository demonstrates how to build, containerize, and deploy a modern Java-based RESTful application from scratch.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project is a simple CRUD-based REST API that manages sample entities (e.g., `Users`, `Products`, or `Tasks`).  
It’s built using **Spring Boot** for rapid development and **Spring Data JPA** for seamless database interactions.  
The goal is to understand how to:
- Structure a Spring Boot project effectively  
- Integrate with relational databases using Spring Data  
- Containerize a Java application with Docker  
- Deploy and scale on AWS services such as ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, or EC2
